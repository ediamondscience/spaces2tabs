# spaces2tabs
spaces2tabs.py is a tool for taking multiple python files using spaces into files using tabs for indentation. 

Usage:

Currently to use this program you must be in the same directory as both spaces2tabs.py and the files that you intend on changing. 
From the command line:
python spaces2tabs.py file0.py file1.py file2.py etc...

For each file that is input, another file with the format filename_tabs.py will be created and output with the corrected indentation style

If you'd like to use spaces2tabs.py anywhere, you can drop it into your bin folder and add an alias to refer python to it.
